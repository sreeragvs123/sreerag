          The history of cinema dates back to the late 19th century when motion pictures were first invented. From silent films to the era of talkies, and the transition from black-and-white to color, cinema has evolved into one of the most influential art forms globally. Key milestones include the Golden Age of Hollywood, the rise of international cinema, and the advent of digital filmmaking.
